When new developers try to make a google chrome extension they may find it difficult to get a headstart and same was the case for me. I was having real diffculty understanding how chrome extensions work but i finally managed to learn how exactly everything works. So, I decided to post my first tutorial on a simple and easily understandable tutorial on "How to make Chrome Extension to change Design of a webpage".

### Why I decided to choose "Change Design" for a chrome extension?

This is because most of the developers who want to make chrome extension usually start with the idea that they want to change the shitty design of a particular website. Well, this was the case for me but if you want to do anything else i will not certainly recommend this tutorial to you but for the rest of you, let's start.

### Step 1: Create Manifest.json File and rest of the things

This tutorial is not for providing a step by step guide to how first create a Manifest file, create stylesheets and js folder and i am assuming you all already know that.

### Consider a Webpage.
